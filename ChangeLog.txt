0.1 - 19 October 2012
	Initial release following a minimalist design
	and a directory structure inspired by ruby projects.
	Called JaroWeb for lack of fantasy, first used to
	create websites as the author's, as well stuff like
	http://pirati5stelle.it or http://democrazialiquida.eu

Earlier around 2010
	Various scripts descend from a rewrite of some Dyne.org
	websites made by Jaromil and Hellekin in Ruysdael Squat.
